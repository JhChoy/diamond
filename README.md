# Foundry Diamond Library (with CreateX)

This repository provides a convenient way to implement the Diamond Proxy pattern ([EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)) in a Foundry (Forge) environment, along with [CreateX](https://github.com/pcaversaccio/createx) integration for multiple deployment methods (create2, create3, etc.).

## Overview
The main goal is to simplify the creation and management of modular, upgradeable smart contracts by leveraging the Diamond Proxy pattern.
This project is inspired by [diamond-3-hardhat](https://github.com/mudgen/diamond-3-hardhat).

You can find the sample boilerplate code at [diamond-boilerplate](https://github.com/JhChoy/diamond-boilerplate). To get started immediately, clone this repository.
